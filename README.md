# Garry's Mod Background Video Replacement

Allows you to replace default gmod background with .webm video
For now it's working a little better than terrible.

## Installation

1. Unpack repo into the `garrysmod/` folder
2. Done

## Config

Add your `background.webm` video into the `garrysmod/background/video/` folder

## Supported filetypes

At the current moment it only supports `background.webm` (since JS does not allow me to read `video/` folder). In the next updates I will try to make it through Lua
